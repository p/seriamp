### Integra

Tested with DTR-50.4.

- Straight cable required (if using a USB to serial adapter which already
contains a serial cable with male end, no additional cable may be needed).
- Receiver socket is female.
- Receiver socket has the nuts for fixing the cable connector.
[This FTDI adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0759HSLP1)
has screws on the serial end and attaches directly to the receiver.
[This PL2303 adapter]((https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IDSM6BW)
has nuts on the serial end and does not attach to the receiver, requiring
either a straight through female to male serial cable or removing the nuts
from one of the ends (the USB to serial adapter is the cheaper device,
I modify the adapters rather than the receivers/amplifiers).

Connection options:

- PC with serial port (male) <-> straight cable female to male <->
  receiver
- USB-serial adapter (male) <-> receiver
